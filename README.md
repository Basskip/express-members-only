# Members Only App

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/members-only) curriculum, creating a small app to practice authentication in Express

## Things I learned
* Using the passport-local strategy for PassportJS

## Things to work on
* Re-style slightly, add a navbar to more consistently see all site links

# Check it out yourself
Download/clone the repository then run using npm

```
git clone git@github.com:Basskip/express-members-only.git
cd expess-members-only
npm install
```
At this point you will need to create a .env file and add your MongoDB URI

```
MONGODB_URI = <YOUR MONGODBURI HERE>
```
After that you can run the project with `npm run start` and navigate to localhost:3000
